# Web-Scraping-with-Text-Summarization

This project scrapes text from a web source (Wikipedia) and summarizes it using NLTK. The text is tokenized, lemmatized and then summarized using sentence scoring. The text is then summarized using Gensim. 

The two generated summaries are compared with gold standard summaries for performance evaluation.
